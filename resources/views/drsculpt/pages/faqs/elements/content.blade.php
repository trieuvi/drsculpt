                            <p class="paragraph-80">CoolSculpting is frequently marketed for $600. &nbsp;This can be misleading, and we want to set the record straight. &nbsp;Six hundred dollars per treatment is a very competitive price for CoolSculpting (our standard price is $900/treatment), but you need at least 2 treatments to symmetrically target both sides of your body (e.g. treating your left and right thighs requires 2 treatments). &nbsp;Furthermore, a single round of treatment only gets you a 20-25% reduction in fat cells. &nbsp;Therefore, most patients elect to have a second round of treatments for more noticeable results.<br> <br>Based on these facts, Dr. Sculpt offers patients multi-treatment CoolSculpting packages that help people get the results they want at a reasonable price point. &nbsp;The price for these packages starts at $2,400 for each area you want to target. &nbsp;For example, if you want slimmer arms then take a look at Dr. Sculpt’s Right To Bare Arms™ package that includes 4 arm treatments for $2,400. &nbsp;On the other hand, if you want to target belly fat you should consider our Absolute Abs™ package which offers you 8 treatment cycles for $5,000.<br><br>Educated consumers consider our packages to be an attractive option when compared to alternatives such as liposuction or plastic surgery, because these surgical options can cost two or even three times more to target similar areas of the body.</p><a href="/supporting-articles-research" class="link-support">Support Articles &amp; Research</a>

The sensations subside as the area becomes numb. Following the procedure, typical side effects include temporary redness, swelling, blanching, bruising, firmness, tingling, stinging, tenderness, cramping, aching, itching, or skin sensitivity, and sensation of fullness in the back of the throat after submental or submandibular area treatment. These effects are temporary and generally resolve within days or weeks.<br><br>Rare side effects may also occur. CoolSculpting may cause visible enlargement in the treated area which may develop two to five months after treatment and requires surgical intervention for correction. As with any medical procedure, ask qualified professional if the CoolSculpting procedure is right for you.<a href="#ref-2" class="link-desktop-7">[2][3][4][5][6][8][9]</a></p><a href="/supporting-articles-research" class="link-support">Support Articles &amp; Research</a>
